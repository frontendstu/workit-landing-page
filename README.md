## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've always struggled with positioning background images and in this project I thoight I'd throw myself into the deepend and just experiement. I found that using `position: absolute;` and `transform: translate();` really made life easier instead of using `inset`. This has given me heaps of confidence moving forward. Now I won't cringe when I see a strange layout that's using a background pattern or an image that is positoned out of something.
